# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement logging system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive logging system for console and Discord channel logging
# Details:
Implement a logging system that logs to both console and Discord channels. Create different log levels (debug, info, warn, error) and ensure logs are formatted consistently. Implement Discord channel logging for errors and important events. Ensure logs include timestamps and relevant context information.

# Test Strategy:
Test logging at different levels and verify that logs appear in both console and appropriate Discord channels. Test error logging to ensure errors are properly captured and reported.
