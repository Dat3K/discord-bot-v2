# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement user role filtering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a system for filtering users based on their roles
# Details:
Implement user role filtering to only track reactions from users with specific roles (e.g., role ID 1162022091630059531). Create functions for fetching all members with a specific role and for checking if a user has a specific role. Ensure role data is kept up-to-date when users' roles change.

# Test Strategy:
Test role filtering by verifying that only reactions from users with the specified role are tracked. Test fetching members with a specific role and checking if a user has a specific role.
