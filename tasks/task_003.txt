# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create configuration system
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a configuration system using environment variables and JSON files
# Details:
Create a configuration system that loads settings from both .env file (for sensitive data like tokens and channel IDs) and a config.json file (for customizable settings like message content and emojis). Implement validation for required configuration values and provide meaningful error messages for missing or invalid configuration.

# Test Strategy:
Test loading configuration from both .env and config.json files. Verify that validation works correctly for required values and that appropriate error messages are displayed.
