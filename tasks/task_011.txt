# Title: Implement regular meal registration system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the system for daily meal registration using reactions
# Details:
Implement the regular meal registration system. Schedule daily messages at 5:00 AM with registration ending at 3:00 AM the next day. Create embed messages with breakfast (‚òÄÔ∏è) and dinner (üåô) reaction options. Store registration data in the database and implement end-of-period reporting to show who registered and who didn't.

# Test Strategy:
Test the meal registration system by verifying that messages are sent at the correct time, reactions are tracked correctly, and end-of-period reports are generated accurately.
