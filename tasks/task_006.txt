# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement timezone handling (GMT+7)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up proper timezone handling for all time-based operations
# Details:
Implement timezone handling using a library like date-fns-tz or luxon. Ensure all time-based operations consistently use GMT+7 timezone. Create utility functions for common time operations like formatting dates, calculating time differences, and scheduling events based on specific times in the GMT+7 timezone.

# Test Strategy:
Test timezone handling by verifying that dates and times are correctly calculated and displayed in GMT+7. Test scheduling functions to ensure they trigger at the correct times.
